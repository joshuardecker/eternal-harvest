# The Video Game: Eternal Harvest
## What is it?
Eternal harvest is a simple 2d, open source video game I have made because video
game development is fun and a good test of the mind. 

Endless waves of ghosts will spawn and it is up the player to defeat each wave 
of ghosts before they defeat you! Various easter eggs, powerups, and unlockable
areas can be found around the finite map. 

In no way is any of this code perfessional, but I am going for a clean, simple,
and modular setup with my code. I do not intend to actively maintain this 
project, its just a little project Im working on right now.
