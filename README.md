# Eternal Harvest
## What is it?
This is a video game in active development. I never intend to make any money on this project, 
and if it ever gets to that point I will likely donate it to charity. The point of this project 
is to instead be a well documented learning tool for anyone to see how I managed a semi-professional 
codebase, to hopefully help in their pursuits of video game development. 

## Where is the project going?
I cant give any specific details, but here is a rough road map in order of what needs to happen:
- Build a polished first attempt of release of the video game itself.
- Get community feedback from people play testing the game to see what needs to change.
- Implement those changes.
- Crack down and document as much useful information about how the games works as I can.
- Move on to the next project.

## How can I play this game?
Currently, you have to compile the game yourself. Download the latest version 4 of the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/download) for 
your os, download this project, import and open it in the Godot editor, and click the run button 
in the top right. Or, hit f5 instead.

## How active is this projects development?
With college starting soon, I cant guarantee anything specific, but if and when I have free time and 
want to work on something interesting, good chance I will work on this project, at least a little bit.
